## Download an OS
- https://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-mate/releases/20.04/release/ubuntu-mate-20.04.2.0-desktop-amd64.iso
- I chose ubuntu mate because I haven't used it before (smart right?).
## Install VM
- https://www.vmware.com/go/getplayer-win
- If your computer has Hyper-V, then check the box on installation (I am on Windows 10, so I checked the box).
- Install VS Code (if you want)
- If you are blind (like me) go to the menu and type **appearance**
- Go to Font, Details, uncheck automatic detection and increase DPI (I chose 128)
- Open terminal and type the traditional "sudo apt-get update && apt-get upgrade" for good luck
